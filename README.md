# Project-3: WEEK 1

Domain Count

Once the userlog.log file is opened and read, my teammate and I plan to create an empty list to store the domains we want to extract from the usersâ€™ emails. We want to read the lines line by line to make sure each one is accounted for. The code we are planning to create will check each line to ensure that the usernames and domain names are separated by the character @. We will use a split() method to make this work. Once they are separated, we record the domain name, track the number of times it occurred, and add them to the empty list.
